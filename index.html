      <p>The process for the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/freedom-information-request-form" target="_blank" title="New York State Senate FOIL Request"> New York State Senate</a> is different than other agencies.</p>
    
  <h3>Documents are available to the public by request</h3>
    <p>Each agency is required to maintain a subject matter list with all categories of records that they keep</p>

  <h3>Each agency has a records address officer and provide their contact information</h3>
    <p>They may also have their own FOIL request form on the agency website</p>

  <h3>Send your request by online form, email, fax, mail or you can deliver in person. </h3>

    <h3>Email</h3>
    <h3>Subject</h3>
      <p>Freedom of Information Law Request </p>
       
    <h3>Write to the person responsible for FOIL requests in the agency</h3>
      <p>Records Access Officer:</p>
        <p>It feels weird to write <em>Dear</em> Records Access Officer. Are they truely dear to you?</p>
        

    <h3>The records you are requesting</h3>
      <p>Under the provisions of the New York Freedom of Information Law, Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, I hereby request records or portions thereof pertaining to (or containing the following)</p> 
          <!-- Followed by bars indicating filling in the space, the same height as the paragraph font -->
          <p>You want to be as specific as possible here, if you’re not sure <a href="resources.html">ask for some advice</a></p>
          <p>Only ask them to copy documents, not to analyze anything</p>

    <h3>Follow up request</h3>
      <p>If my request is too broad or does not reasonably describe the records, please contact me via email so that I may clarify my request, and when appropriate inform me of the manner in which records are filed, retrieved or generated.</p>
        <p>If your request is not specific enough, this asks them to contact you instead of rejecting your request</p>

    <h3>Your contact information</h3>
      <p>If it is necessary to modify my request, and an email response is not preferred, please contact me at the following telephone number</p>
        <!-- Followed by bars indicating filling in the space, the same height as the paragraph font -->
          <p>Make it easy for them to contact you, don’t give them an excuse not to!</p>

    <h3>Ask them to email you the documents, if that’s the method you prefer.</h3>
      <p>Please email the records if possible. If all of the requested records cannot be emailed to me, please inform me by email of the portions that can be emailed and advise me of the cost for reproducing the remainder of the records requested. If the requested records cannot be emailed to me due to the volume of records identified in response to my request, please advise me of the actual cost of copying all records onto a CD .</p>
        <p>They don’t have a reason to send you a nice PDF unless you explicitly ask for it</p>

    <h3>Yes, there are fees</h3>
      <p>If there are any fees in excess of $5.00 for copying the records requested, please inform me before filling the request. Please supply the records without informing me if the fees are not in excess of $5.00.</p>
        <p>If a government employee spends more than 2 hours retrieving and copying records you may be charged for their time</p>

    <h3>Polietly remind them that they’re supposed to confirm that they got your request within 5 days. </h3>  
      <p>As you know, the Freedom of Information Law requires that an agency respond to a request within five business days of receipt of a request. Therefore, I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and look forward to hearing from you shortly.</p>
        <p>They aren’t held to any timeline for actually completing your request, it can take a couple of months to a year</p>
        <p>If you don’t hear from them within 5 days, send <a href="#timely">an appeal letter</a></p>

    <h3>If they reject your request, ask them for the reason and the contact for the appeals officer</h3>
      <p> If for any reason any portion of my request is denied, please inform me of the reasons for the denial in writing and provide the name and address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed.</p>
       <p>You will need the appeals officer information and the reason your request was rejected for your appeal letter</p>

    <h3>Your Contact Information</h3>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Your name</p>
    <p>Address</p>
    <p>Email</p>
    <p>Phone Number</p>
      <p>Sincerely!</p>

  <h3>If they haven't responded within 5 days</h3>
    <p>More than five business days have passed since the receipt of the request without having received a response.</p>

  <h3>If they didn't respond by the time they said they would</h3>
   <p>Although the receipt of the request was acknowledged and I was informed that a response would be given by date, no response has been given.</p>

  <h3>No response is a rejection, that’s why you’re appealing.</h3>
    <p>Consequently, I consider the request to have been denied, and I am appealing on that basis.</p>

  <h3>They have 10 days to respond to your appeal</h3>
    <p> As required by the Freedom of Information Law, the head or governing body of an agency, or whomever is designated to determine appeals, is required to respond within 10 business days of the receipt of an appeal. </p>

  <h3>If they reject your appeal, they’ve got to tell you why in writing</h3>
   <p>If the records are denied on appeal, please explain the reasons for the denial fully in writing as required by law.</p>
    <p>It's the law!</p>

  <h3>Remind them that they have to send appeals to the Committee on Open Government</h3>
    <p> In addition, please be advised that the Freedom of Information Law directs agencies to send all appeals and the determinations that follow to the Committee on Open Government, Department of State, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Ave., Albany, New York 12231.</p>
