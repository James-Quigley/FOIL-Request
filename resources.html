      <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/index.html">Committee On Open Government</a>
        <p>The Committee is responsible for overseeing and advising with regard to the Freedom of Information Law, the Open Meetings Law and the Personal Privacy Protection Law (Public Officers Law, Articles 6, 7 and 6-A respectively).</p>

      <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/">Muckrock</a>
        <p>MuckRock helps anyone file, track and share public records requests, using a mix of software and hands-on help to make the process as easy and transparent as possible.</p>

      <a href="https://www.nfoic.org/organizations/state-foi-resource/new-york-foi-resources">National Freedom of Information Coalition</a>
         <p>The organization and members protect our right to open government by ensuring state and local governments and public institutions have laws, policies and procedures to facilitate press and public access to information and proceedings.</p>

      <a href="https://www.reclaimnewyork.org/foil-request/">Reclaim New York</a>
        <p>Reclaim New York has put together a user manual explaining the FOIL process and produced a flowchart showing the timeline to follow when submitting a FOIL request. Reclaim has also created three templates for you to use to help get you started (a FOIL request, an appeal letter if your request is ignored, and an appeal letter if your request is denied).</p>

      <a href="https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/">Open Records</a>
        <p>You can request records from every New York City agency by filing a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request. But, some government information is already available online and you wouldn’t need to go through the FOIL process. Government reports and data are available. Almost all City agencies also use this platform to respond to FOIL requests and publish records not covered by privacy and other protections.</p>

      <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/freedom-information-request-form">The New York State Senate</a>
        <p>The FOIL request process for the NY State Senate is different than other agencies</p>


    <h1 id="about">About this Project</h1>

    <p>This site was created by <a href="https://annastypul.com/">Anna "Ania" Stypulkowski</a> and <a href="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/">Chris Deluca</a> of a href="https://astoria.digital/">Astoria Digital</a>, a team of volunteers making web apps to support community organizing. It is meant to be a friendly introduction to the FOIL request process in New York State, to support existing resources.</p>
    <p>This project was created to support existing Freedom of Information Law resources by representing the FOIL Request process in New York State and providing resources to submit a request. Please <a href="mailto:ania@astoria.digital">reach out to us</a> if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>
